# Jitsi Chat Exporter Web Extension

During a Jitsi video conference, the team decided to contribute our chat logs to the [Mozilla Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org) project. To fulfill this goal, we created a web browser extension that extracts the text messages from the chat history.

**How to use:**

On a Jitsi meeting, open the chat sidebar and click on the add-on icon. A button appears below the chat sidebar. Click to get the messages copied into the clipboard.

Notice that in the current version, we only copy the text. No other data is copied. The reason goes back to the very first motivation of making this add-on: get text to donate to Common Voice project.

To request more features, feel free to contribute or suggest them in an issue on the project's repository.

***⚠️ Please inform the people in the room before extracting the messages.***
